Grapher.js
==========

Grapher is a simple Javascript library built for displaying relationship based information. It makes use of the great drawing library, [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com "Raphael").

There are function reference inline comments inside the grapher.js file. I'd recommend you review the [Raphael documentation](http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html "Raphael Docs") before attempting to use this library.

Grapher.js is written by [James Kirsop](http://www.jameskirsop.com "James Kirsop") to fill a desire to learn more about Javascript and a need for a free graphing library for my regular job. You can contact me via james.kirsop@gmail.com. I have plans to open source the library in the future, but at the moment I've not decided on a license.

The 'Tests' folder contains a simple HTML file as an example of how one might use the library. It also serves as the tool used to ensure the various charts etc. are rendering correctly.
